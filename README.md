# Credit-Card-Fraud-Analytics-using-ML
The rapid participation in online based transactional activities raises the fraudulent cases all over the world and causes tremendous losses to individuals and financial industry.  
Thus, countering the fraud activities through machine learning is one of the prominent approaches intending to prevent the losses caused by these illegal acts. 

Machine Learning techniques were employed to study the patterns and characteristics, predict the suspicious and non-suspicious transactions automatically by using classifiers. 

Therefore, supervised based classification was able to identify genuine and non-genuine transactions by learning the patterns of the data and logistic regression and random forest classifiers are to be applied .  

The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud.

This model is then used to identify if a new transactions is genuine or not. 

The aim is to perform analytics on fraudulent transactions and train a model in such a way the model will predict the fraud activities with better performance.

As usage of credit cards become more and more common in every field of the daily life, credit card fraud has become much more rampant. From the experiments, the result that has been concluded is that logistic regression has an accuracy of 97% while Random forest shows accuracy of 99%. The results obtained thus conclude that Random forest shows the most precise and high accuracy of 99% in the problem of credit card fraud detection with the dataset of European cardholders dataset.

The Random forest algorithm will perform better with a larger number of training data, but speed during testing and application will suffer. Application of more preprocessing techniques would also help. The logistic regression still requires more preprocessing to give better results on the data.
